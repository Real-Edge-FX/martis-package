# Upgrading

> **These docs describe Martis v2.** Martis v1.x read `Select` and `MultiSelect` options as `[label => value]`; v2.0 and later read `[value => label]`, Nova's order. If your app still runs v1.x, flip the option arrays in the examples, or upgrade with the steps below.

The sections below list the breaking changes of each major version and what to change in an app.

## Upgrading to v2.0 from v1.x

Require the new major; a `^1.x` constraint never installs it:

```bash
composer require martis/martis:^2.0
```

Then clear the schema cache, so no form keeps options read in the v1 order (the schema cache never expires by default):

```bash
php artisan martis:cache:clear schema
```

### Choice-field options follow Nova's order (high impact)

`Select::options()` and `MultiSelect::options()` read `[value => label]`, the order Nova uses for `Select`, `MultiSelect` and `BooleanGroup`: the array key is what the field stores, the array value is what the user sees. v1.x read the array the other way round, `[label => value]`.

| Call | v1.x stored | v2.0 stores |
|---|---|---|
| `options(['Draft' => 'draft'])` | `draft` | `Draft` |
| `options(['draft' => 'Draft'])` | `Draft` | `draft` |
| `options(fn () => User::pluck('name', 'id')->all())` | the name | the id |
| `options(['draft', 'published'])` | `draft`, `published` | `0`, `1` |

Nothing fails at runtime when an array keeps the v1 order: the field stores the label instead of the value. Review every call.

**What to change:**

1. **Flip every associative array written label first.** `['Draft' => 'draft']` becomes `['draft' => 'Draft']`, and `pluck('id', 'name')` becomes `pluck('name', 'id')`.
2. **Turn lists into maps.** A list is read as Nova reads it, keyed 0, 1, 2…, so `['draft', 'published']` now stores `0` and `1`. When each value is its own label, pass `array_combine($values, $values)`; for an enum, pass the class (`options(Status::class)`) instead of a list of its values.
3. **Rewrite MultiSelect groups in Nova's format.** `['Backend' => ['PHP' => 'php']]` becomes `['php' => ['label' => 'PHP', 'group' => 'Backend']]`. The old format now throws an `InvalidArgumentException` that names the field and the option.
4. **Replace `optionsFromMap()` with `options()`.** It was removed: `options()` reads the same `[value => label]` map and also takes a closure. A call left behind fails with an undefined-method error.
5. **Check `searchOptionsUsing()` closures.** They return the same shapes as `options()`, in the same order, so a list is keyed 0, 1, 2 and stores a position in that search's results, which changes with the term. Return `[value => label]`, for example `->pluck('name', 'id')->all()`, or `array_combine($values, $values)` when each value is its own label. The stored-label warning does not see these: their options come from a closure.
6. **Update generated code.** The `BulkAssignRole` action that `martis:roles` generates builds its role picker with `pluck('id', 'name')`; with v2.0 it would receive the role name and answer "That role no longer exists". Change it to `pluck('name', 'id')` (new scaffolds already do). If you published the stubs with `martis:stubs`, update `stubs/martis/roles-bulk-assign-role-action.stub` the same way. The `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` primers that `martis:agents` wrote under v1.x recommend `options($enum::values())`, which v2.0 reads as a list: regenerate them with `php artisan martis:agents --force` (update `stubs/martis/agents/AGENTS.md.stub` first if you published it).
7. **Subclasses.** A subclass of `MultiSelect` that overrides `options()` must accept `array|string|\Closure`, since `MultiSelect::options()` now takes an enum class too.

**Finding the calls:**

```bash
grep -rnF -e '->options(' -e 'optionsFromMap(' -e 'searchOptionsUsing(' app/
```

Every `Select` and `MultiSelect` hit needs a look; a filter's `public function options(Request $request)` does not (see below). A multi-line chain shows only its `options(` line, so read each hit in its file.

**Records saved with the wrong order.** A field whose array was already written value first under v1.x (for example `['admin' => 'Administrator']`) stored the label. v2.0 reads that array correctly, so those records hold a label where a value is expected: fix the stored values with a data migration.

**The stored-label warning.** Reading a record whose stored value matches the label of a static option and the value of none logs a warning, in production too, at most once per request for each model class and field, naming the model, the record, the field and the value. It fires in both cases above: an array still written label first, and a record saved while it was. Options that come from a closure are not checked. It names the first matching record only and never checks options that come from a closure (the `pluck()` case), so to find every affected record, query the column for values that are labels.

**What does not change:**

- **Filters** keep Nova's filter order, `[label => value]`: a filter's `options(Request $request)` is unchanged, exactly as in Nova.
- **`BooleanGroup`** already read `[flag key => label]`.
- **Enum classes** (`options(Status::class)`) store the case value, as before; `MultiSelect` now accepts them too.
- **The field payload** keeps its shape (`options: [{label, value, group?}]`), so custom frontend components keep working. `group` is new on `Select`, whose dropdown now shows grouped options under their headings.
